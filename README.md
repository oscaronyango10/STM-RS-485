Steps to Configure RS-485 Communication in STM32

    Hardware Setup:
        Connect the STM32 microcontroller to an RS-485 transceiver chip (e.g., MAX485).
        Ensure the DE (Driver Enable) and RE (Receiver Enable) pins of the transceiver are controlled by a GPIO pin from the STM32.

    CubeMX Configuration:
        Open STM32CubeMX and create a new project for your specific STM32 microcontroller.
        Configure the USART peripheral you intend to use for RS-485 (e.g., USART1).
        Set the USART mode to asynchronous.
        Enable the necessary GPIO pins for TX, RX, and the DE/RE control pin.
        Configure the baud rate, word length, stop bits, and parity according to your RS-485 network requirements.

    HAL Library Code:
        Generate the initialization code using CubeMX.
        Implement the RS-485 communication logic using the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) library functions.
